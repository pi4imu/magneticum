This is Radially-Resolved Cluster Database (RRCD) for 84 galaxy clusters from Magneticum simulations.

See *papername* for details.

There is figure named 'panels.png' which includes images of all 84 clusters and their numbers. 

To obtain a spectra of the cluster print `model atable{RRCD_magneticum.fits}` in xspec and accurately write:

1) the number of the cluster (first parameter), 
2) desired radius in units of projected R_500 (second parameter; possible values are {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5}),
3) normalization (third parameter).

Please ignore the default values.

Made with the help of xspec-table-models (https://github.com/mbursa/xspec-table-models).

There is also a small script named 'atable.xcm' which (a) simulates observations with eROSITA's TM1 () calculates single-temperature approximation of th
