This is Radially-Resolved Clusters' Spectra Database (RRCS_DB) for 84 galaxy clusters from Magneticum simulations.

See *papername* for details.

There is figure named 'panels.png' which includes images of all 84 clusters. Every image contains cluster's number and position of gravitational potential minimum from Magneticum catalogue; there is also a circle with the radius equal to projected R_500 for this cluster with its center located at centroid of the image. 

To obtain a spectra of the cluster (note: at z=0) print `model atable{RRCD_magneticum.fits}` in xspec and write:

1) the number of the cluster (first parameter), 
2) desired radius in units of projected R_500 (second parameter; possible values are {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5}),
3) normalization (third parameter).

Please ignore the default values. There is no fool-proof protection from entering the wrong parameters.

This atable model was made with the help of xspec-table-models script (https://github.com/mbursa/xspec-table-models).

There is also a small script named 'atable.xcm' which (a) simulates observations with eROSITA's TM1, (b) calculates single-temperature approximation of these observations.
